# TinDog - A Front-End Project Using Bootstrap

## Overview

TinDog is a fun and interactive front-end project designed to mimic a dating app, but for dogs! This project is built entirely using **Bootstrap 5**, a popular front-end framework that allows for responsive and mobile-first web development. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface using Bootstrap components, utilities, and grid system.

This project does not include a backend or any functionality. It is purely a front-end design project.
